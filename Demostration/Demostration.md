# Welcome to Liri!
## Here is a quick break down of what to expect.

To get started simply type "node liri" and a greeting with instructions will pop up. 

>$ node liri

![node liri](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSauermilch/liri-node-app/master/images/Welcome%20Respone.PNG "Liri Greeting")

Once we see what our commands are we can then search to see if there is a chance to see Sweden's GraveYard on tour anytime soon...

>$ node liri concert GraveYard

Oh! Looks like they are. Hopefully they'll make it to the states. However, I really wish I could have seen AC/DC live but RIP Malcom. I when was Black in Back released?

>$ node liri song back in black

As mentioned earlier Liri is capable to searching movies using OMDB. Remember the Matrix?

>$ node liri movie matrix

![liri movie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSauermilch/liri-node-app/master/images/node%20movie.PNG "Liri movie")

Hmmmm Not the Matrix I remember.... And for those who like the satifaction of ordering off secert menus... there is an option...

>$ node liri movie

I hope these instrutions are helpful. Play around with Liri. See what Siri would have been like if she was created in 1990. Cheers!
